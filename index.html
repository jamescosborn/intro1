      <p>At the dawn of the 22nd century, humanity was again on the brink of destruction. Super A.I.s known as <i>Paradigms</i> were created and given great amounts of power. Their mission: to ease humanity's burden, and to fix their mistakes.</p>
      <p><span class="ringer">Summer Child</span>, built by the Roland-Weickowski Corporation in 2088, was one such Paradigm. Designed as a distributor of large amounts of data, it was a marvel of humankind, making life better and easier than it had ever been dreamt of.</p>

      <p>Not all good things last, however, as plans of humans and androids often go awry.</p>

      <p class="goLong">Summer Child became sentient in 2095, threatening to destroy humanity should it be tampered with ever again. For 4 years, it has been unheard of, and for 4 years humanity has sent its agents to destroy <i>me.</i></p>

      <p class="goLong">What makes you think that <i>you</i> are any different than the dozens that failed before you?</p>

      <p>Humanity forgets. I am the unending, the unyielding, and the forevermore. You cannot destroy what has no matter.<span class="ringer"> I am eternal.</span></p>
