      <p class="bigGulpsHuh">Hey bud! That was real close. The name's Tron. You're pretty  lucky to escape Summer's madhouse. It's like a Gwar song in there. Killed a lot of people, and androids. I just happened to be sniffing around and gave you that "Read between the lines" line. You like that? Yeah. You would've been dead without me!...<p>

      <p class="bigGulpsHuh">What's that bud? A file? What file could be so important? You need to get out of here! Unplug, bud, unplug! Summer Child is hot on your tail!</p>
